    <h1>Privacy Policy - Newslyglot App</h1>
    <p>We at Newslyglot are committed to protecting your privacy while you use our language-learning app. This policy is designed to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have about the data we collect.</p>

    <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> When you sign up for Newslyglot, you must confirm that you are at least 13 years old to ensure the app is appropriate for your age. This helps us maintain a suitable environment for learning and prevents any violation of our Terms of Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Statistics:</strong> As you use Newslyglot, we collect anonymized usage statistics to help improve our app. These stats may include how long you spend on each page or section, the features you most frequently access, and other data that helps us understand how our users interact with the app. This information is essential for making informed decisions about future updates and improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Ads:</strong> To keep Newslyglot free for everyone, we use Google Ads to display targeted ads on the app. These ads may collect anonymous data such as your gender and age to show relevant advertisements that might interest you. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's privacy policy</a> to learn more about how they manage this information.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We use third-party services for analytics, marketing, and other app operations. These services might collect anonymized data like the device you are using (e.g., make, model), your language preferences, or other technical data to help improve our app's performance.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How Do We Use the Information?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Improve Newslyglot:</strong> By analyzing usage statistics and feedback from users, we can create a better learning experience for everyone by improving the app's functionality, user interface, and overall quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Targeted Advertising:</strong> The anonymous data collected through Google Ads helps us tailor our ad content to provide a more enjoyable user experience and ensure you see ads that are relevant to your interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Sharing:</strong> We may share the non-personal information we collect with third parties like Google for analytics, advertising, or marketing purposes. However, this data is always aggregated and anonymized, ensuring your personal privacy remains protected.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> In rare cases, we might need to disclose personally identifiable information if required by law or when necessary to protect our legal rights or the safety of our users.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>We believe that everyone has a right to control their data, and Newslyglot provides you with multiple options to manage your privacy:</p>
    <ol></ol>
        <li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Newslyglot respects your browser's "do not track" settings. If you enable the do-not-track setting in your browser, we will disable tracking technologies that might collect data about your app usage. However, this does not prevent Google Ads from collecting information through targeted advertising.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Choices:</strong> Although Newslyglot does not collect or share personal user data with advertisers, you can still manage ad preferences by visiting the <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Ad Settings page</a>. Here, you can customize the types of ads you see while browsing the web or using apps like ours.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time without prior notice. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised privacy policy on our website. We encourage users to review this page periodically to ensure they are aware of any updates or modifications.</p>

    <h2>Contacting Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@newslyglot.com">support@newslyglot.com</a>. We will respond promptly and do our best to address your concerns.</p>

    <p>By using Newslyglot, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this privacy policy.</p>
